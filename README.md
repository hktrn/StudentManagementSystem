# StudentManagementSystem

This program is a Student Management System with CRUD capabilities and a REST API. 

## Packages

You will need gorm and fiberv2. Depending on which database you want to connect you can import, I used SQLite

require (
	github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2 v2.32.0
	gorm.io/driver/sqlite v1.3.1
	gorm.io/gorm v1.23.4
)
```

## How to use
1. You could run the main.exe file
2. in the Terminal or concole 
```sh
go run main.go setup.go
 ```

## Couple of words from me
Thank you for your time for viewing my project. I made this project to learn more about Go to add to my programming languages list and chose to make a CRM to learn more about data structures and REST APIs.
